# Advent Of Code (aoc)
This is my repository of the various years of Advent Of Code challenges I've worked on. Advent Of Code was and still remains one of the most meaningful contributions towards my progression as a programmer, and I highly recommend it for anybody wanting to really get in-depth with coding.

Please check out the individual years, especially if you're here to assess my evolving proficiency as a software developer :)

In the meantime, enjoy some top-level stats:
