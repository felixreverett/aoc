# Advent Of Code 2022
My solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code. This is the first year I'll be "backdating", after starting aoc properly from 2023.

My initial objective is to use this as an opportunity to familiarise myself with the syntax of Scala. More broadly, I want to strengthen my understanding of functional programming etiquette, such as the avoidance of mutable states, and the use of the functional toolkit made available to me.
